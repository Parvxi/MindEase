# MindEaseApp
MindEase is an application that takes EEG data from the Emotiv device and uses ML to predict whether the person using the device is stressed or not.

## About MindEase
The application uses Emotiv's EEG measurement technology to collect data from the user's brain activity. The EEG data is processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms that have been trained to identify patterns associated with stress. The application then makes a prediction based on the data analysis.
